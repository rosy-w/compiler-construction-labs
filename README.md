## Lab Activity 1
Give brief descriptions of the following tools:

Flex, Bison, Lex, Yacc

The description should have: 3-5 lines definition, diagram and code snippet

Submit a text file having the link to your Github repo having the colab/jupyter nb file.

## Lab Activity 2
a. Using any TWO examples, show the conversion of NFA to DFA
[For assistance, I have attached two files on E-Learning to act as a guide. You are also
free to use any other conversion methods that you prefer]
For submission, you can draw the necessary diagrams by hand or using a computer tool,
then attach a screenshot to your lab activity running file.


b. Using the material on E-Learning, show how to use Flex and Bison when building a
simple lexical analyzer.

## Lab Activity 3

Review the structure of the Flex input file.

Thereafter, develop a simple lexer by developing your own Flex input file.

## Lab Activity 4

1. Using an example or illustration, explain what is predictive parsing?
2. As an extension to question 1,

      a. What is LL (1) parsing?

      b. Why do we get the First () and Follow () i.e. what do these two    functions really represent?

3. Are there any unique attributes associated with Top-Down parsing?
